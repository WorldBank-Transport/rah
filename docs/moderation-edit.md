The first time you log in to Prose, you may have to provide access to your Github repositories.

## 2. Edit the index.md
Open the file `index.md`

## 3. Edit content and metadata
Each project consists of a main content block with a description of the analysis and corresponding metadata.

Edit the main content block:

### 4. Commit changes
Once you're ready to publish your changes, hit the save button on the right side. You'll be asked to provide a description of your changes.

# Rural Accessibility Hub
This project is part of the [Rural Accessibility Map](http://ruralaccess.info). The RAM toolset is used to generate insight into the accessibility of rural populations. Once people generate analysis in their instance of RAM, they can export those results and share them with a wider public.
